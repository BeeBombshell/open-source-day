**We're excited to announce that Grace Hopper Celebration Open Source Day is open for project, mentor, and workshop applications!**

If you're an open source project maintainer, an experienced open source contributor, or have stories and ideas to share related to open source, we invite you to join us to be part of Open Source Day 2022.

**[Apply now](https://bit.ly/osd22-cfp) to take part in the movement to increase diversity in open source!**


### Projects

CFP Closes: Monday, June 20th at 11:59 pm US PDT

We're looking for open source projects to partner with for the event. Projects participating in OSD must provide triaged issues (non-documentation and "good first issue" labeled) and have one or more (up to 3) project maintainers participate during the event to help attendees contribute to their project. As a project partner, you'll be responsible for introducing your project, answering project related questions, providing guidance to assigned mentors, and helping attendees contribute to your project. Projects that engage in the event not only gain visibility and same-day contributions, but also benefit of widening their pool of future contributors!

### Mentors

CFP Closes: Monday, June 20th at 11:59 pm US PDT

We're looking for mentors that will assist project maintainers in supporting attendees with their contribution to open source projects. Some of the responsibilities include walking attendees through finding a project, an issue to work on, setting up their local environment, answering git related questions, explaining the contribution requirements for the project, discussing how to solve a problem, reviewing code, and more!

### Workshops

CFP Closes: Monday, June 20th at 11:59 pm US PDT

We're looking for workshop content from all skill levels and backgrounds on content focused on open source. We're seeking talks about open source technologies, projects, processes, community, emerging technology, and more to help attendees level up their open source contribution skills.
