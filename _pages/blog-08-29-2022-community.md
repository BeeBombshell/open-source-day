<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">When asked why they contribute to open source and volunteer for events like Open Source Day, time and again, our speakers, project leads, and mentors say the same thing: <b>community</b>. <br/><br/>

Hear from OSD mentors and project representatives who believe open source is all bout the community!
 They share advice for first time contributors and their personal story on how they got started with open source.</p>

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Nupur</b>: "Try learning about version control, say Git/Mercurial before making your first contribution. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty, everyone makes mistakes. Finally, participate in community discussions, ask for help and take the time you need to grow together!"

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Nupur</b>: "My inspiration to get into open source was hearing success stories of seniors in college. My journey started in sophomore year, when I suggested a proposal for Google Summer of Code. While I didn't get in, I learnt a lot about Git, making contributions and searching for the right projects and communities.
  <br/><br/>
  I came back stronger the following years, where I participated in Rails Girls Summer of Code (Servo, Mozilla 2018) and Outreachy (Firefox, Mozilla 2019). I also contributed to the Open Sourced AutoML framework during my research work at the UPenn."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Why did you choose to participate in OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Nupur</b>: "Open source has been an amazing journey for me. The communities I have interacted with have been supportive, inclusive and considerate about my time zones. I am ever thankful to my managers and mentors who rooted for me. 
  <br/><br/>
  This OSD, I want to give back to the community: Empower people to contribute to some amazing projects with collaborators over the world. I wish to inspire all to venture into their own open source journeys :)"

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Trista</b>: "My advice is to keep you curiosity and try these good-first-issues to pick up your favorite project or community. Then dive into it!"

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Trista</b>: "My open source adventure came from the ShardingSphere project. I am one of its founders, and I introduced it to the Apache Foundation. At first, I simply want to share my ideas and provide implementation to the public. Afterward, more and more people became interested in it and desired to participate in it. Thanks for your interest and efforts in this community! I am eager to work on and discuss all things around database, distributed system, and cloud!"

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Meenakshi</b>: "Don't let the complexity or kind of contribution hold you back or cause you to put off creating your first pull request (PR). No matter how seasoned a programmer or contributor is, filtering good-first-issue or low-hanging-fruit labels makes it easy to get started with a new codebase or repository. My first contribution was to correct a typo in the software documentation I was using. If you find it difficult to raise a PR or feel stuck, as is common when doing anything for the first time, the good news is that you can obtain all the support you want; simply ask."

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Meenakshi</b>: "I was introduced to the world of open source while studying for my Master's degree at the Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research (SICSR). Our professor constantly encouraged us to utilise open source software, which prompted us to install a Linux distribution for the operating system, as a result of which I learned how to use the command line, navigate documents, and dual boot my machine at the time. 
  <br/><br/>
  When I first installed Arch Linux and saw that it didn't come with any drivers, I felt as though I had to buy furniture for my house since I had to install the required packages for audio and video.
  <br/><br/>
  The Linux command line allowed me to enter the OS's codebase and add a sound effect when I signed in, as well as customize it to my satisfaction. This was one of the first times I experienced how liberating open source made me feel. By the time I learned Git and discovered Github, I had already graduated. I used to search for open source projects to work on when I started my first job, and that is how I learned that a large number of people from Thoughtworks, my former employer, contribute to and maintain Bahmni, an EMR system based on the OpenMRS project.
  <br/><br/>
  Consequently, I raised my first code PR that involved adding a missing JUnit test. It took some time because I had to pull changes, raise the pull request, and learn how to squash commits, but I was very happy when it was done. 
  <br/><br/>
  I was overjoyed when, after merging it into the main branch, a maintainer from another country reacted and praised me for my contribution to the codebase. I felt like I was a part of something bigger and we were all in it together."

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Mandy</b>: "The community is always more important than the code. Think of your participation as an ongoing conversation with the other members of the community. Talk though what you are doing; and give time to listen to others as they explain their work.  Then there will be no surprises when you submit your contribution."

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Mandy</b>: "I was in software product development for over 30 years in a large technology company, when I was given the challenge to build a solution for metadata exchange and governance.  The aim was to create software that could be adopted across the technology industry.  Wide-spread adoption is only possible if the software is developed in an open and fair way with the resulting function free for all to use.  Open source was the obvious approach and so the Egeria project was born.  
  <br/><br/>
  In the early days, it took a lot of courage to push the first versions of the code into GitHub.  It seemed strange to be giving away such valuable function.  I felt that everyone was watching and would see all of the mistakes in it.  However, my fears and concerns soon passed.  Software is never "perfect".  It takes a process of continually adding improvements to make it better.  The sooner it is public, the more eyes can see it, and help to make it better.
  <br/><br/>
  I am immensely proud of what we have achieved. There as so many difficult problems we have solved together.  And as a community, we are going from strength to strength. We are making a difference and having a lot of fun in the process."
