> 2022 GHC Open Source Day will take place **virtually on September 16th 2022 from 8am to 3pm US Pacific Time.**

Open Source Day (OSD) is an all-day hackathon (including workshops) at [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in which participants of all skill levels learn about Open Source while contributing to projects designed to solve real-world problems.

OSD provides an opportunity for attendees of all skill levels and backgrounds to learn and experience open source contributions with the support of project maintainers, experienced mentors, and expert speakers, providing a fast track to becoming open source contributors. 

During OSD, attendees can join a project on the **Contribution Track** and/or attend one or more workshops from the **Learning track**.

### Contribution Track
On the Contribution Track, attendees will contribute code to our partner open source software (OSS) projects. Attendees can choose to work solo or in groups on an issue and have opportunities to meet project maintainers and experienced mentors who will be available throughout the day to help them make their OSS contribution. Additionally, as part of the contribution track, we have a "Choose your own adventure" option, where attendees have the opportunity to contribute code to projects led by women maintainers or to just any project in the OSS community with mentors available to help!

### Learning Track
On the Learning Track, attendees can attend hands-on workshops to help them overcome the barriers to making open source contributions. Attendees will have a chance to attend technical and non-technical workshops and walk away with skills they can leverage in open source contributions.

### Are you new to Open Source? Don't worry. You will not be alone!
The Open Source Day team and participants will be there to guide you through finding issues suited for your skill level and support you throughout the day to help you make your first or many OSS contributions!
