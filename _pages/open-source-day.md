2022 GHC Open Source Day will take place virtually on September 16th 2022 from 8am to 3pm US Pacific Time.

Open Source Day (OSD) is an all-day hackathon (including workshops) at [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in which participants of all skill levels learn about Open Source while contributing to projects designed to solve real-world problems.

OSD provides an opportunity for participants of all skill levels and backgrounds to learn and experience open source contributions with the support of project maintainers, experienced mentors, and expert speakers, providing a fast track to becoming open source contributors. 

During OSD, participants can join a project on the **Contribution Track** and/or attend one or more workshops from the **Learning track**.

### Contribution Track (Projects)
On the Contribution Track, participants will contribute code to our partner open source software (OSS) projects.
 Participants can choose to work solo or in groups on an issue and have opportunities to meet project maintainers
 and experienced mentors who will be available throughout the day to help them make their OSS contribution.
 Additionally, as part of the contribution track, we have a "Choose your own adventure" option, where participants
 have the opportunity to contribute code to projects led by women maintainers or to any project in the OSS
 community with mentors available to help!

### Learning Track (Workshops)
On the Learning Track, participants can attend hands-on workshops to help them overcome the barriers to making
 open source contributions. Participants will have a chance to attend technical and non-technical workshops and walk
 away with skills they can leverage in open source contributions.

## Project Participation Questions
##### What is the time commitment for project participation?

Before the event, all selected project partners are required to take some time to create good first issues, share
 project guidelines with assigned mentors, and work on a short presentation to introduce the project during the event.

During the event, we require at least one project representative to be present at all times. A Featured project
 can bring up to 3 representatives and Choose Your Own Adventure projects can bring up to 2 project representatives.
 Among the representatives, you are free to divide up the time (8 am to 3 pm Pacific) to choose who will be available
 at what time.

##### Can I submit a project with more than one repository?

Yes! As long as multiple repositories represent one project and project maintainers have the skills to review code
 contributions and have access to merge pull requests in all participating repos.

##### Can we reject/close out the pull requests that does not meet our project's requirements?

Open Source Day does not give contributors a short-cut to their contributions. All participants will be required to abide
 by project's code of conduct and other guidelines you have set in place. The Open Source Day team do not expect any of
 our project partners to accept/merge any work that does not meet project's standards and expectations. We kindly ask
 you to be mindful that some participants may be new to open source contribution and decide how you want to handle the
 contributions made to your project.
