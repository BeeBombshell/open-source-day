 a mentor, or a participant.

# Project Participation

### What is the time commitment for project participation?

Before the event, all selected project partners are required to take some time to create good first issues, share
 project guidelines with assigned mentors, and work on a short presentation to introduce the project during the event.

During the event, we require at least one project representative to be present at all times. A Featured project
 can bring up to 3 representatives and Choose Your Own Adventure projects can bring up to 2 project representatives.
 Among the representatives, you are free to divide up the time (8am to 3pm Pacific) to choose who will be available
 at what time.

### Can I submit a project with more than one repository?

Yes! As long as multiple repositories represent one project and project maintainers have the skills to review code
 contributions and have access to merge pull requests in all participating repos.

### Can we reject/close out the pull requests that does not meet our project's requirements?

Open Source Day does not give contributors a shortcut to their contributions. All participants will be required to abide by the project's code of conduct and other guidelines. The Open Source Day team does not expect any of our project partners to accept/merge any work that does not meet the projectâ€™s standards and expectations. We kindly ask you to bear in mind that some participants may be new to open source as you decide how to handle the contributions made to your project.

### Can we have extra materials to guide participants that are not necessarily on Github?

Yes, it is acceptable to have other contribution guides to make it easier for those wishing to contribute to your project. Kindly make sure to let the contributors know before they start their contributions.

### Is it possible to know the number of registered participants to our projects before OSD?

The number of registered participants for each project will be sent to the project representatives to enable them to prepare prior to OSD. However, this might be sent at a closer date to OSD.

### Will we be merging PRs only as project representatives on OSD?

Project representatives are expected to keep track of contributions made to their projects, make sure participants follow their code of conduct while contributing and in some cases help the mentors incase there is an issue in addition to merging PRs.

### Will we be using one zoom room for all projects during OSD?

Each featured project will have its own zoom room in order to handle the large numbers of participants that will be interested in contributing to the projects. 
However, all CYOA projects will be in one zoom room.

### How will we explain extra details about our project to participants before they start contributing ?

OSD will officially start at 8 AM PT but contributions will begin at 8:30 AM PT, this is to allow project representatives and mentors to have an info session with the interested contributors. This will be the time to familiarise the participants with your project.

### What is the time commitment for mentor participation?

Before the event, all selected mentors will be asked to complete onboarding task(s) to familiarize themselves with
 the assigned project. Time spent may vary based on your experience.

 participants.

# Workshop Participation

### What is the time commitment for workshop participation?

Before the event, all selected speakers will need to prepare their content and attend a rehearsal with one or more
 OSD committee members.

During the event, speakers need to commit approximately 2 hours. Each workshop is expected to be an hour, but we will ask the speakers to join early for production setup and stay after for ~30 minutes to answer questions on Slack.


### What topics would be best fit for Open Source Day workshop?

We accept both technical and non-technical content related to open source. Any topic that will allow OSD participants to walk away with a skill they can utilize in open source contribution will be considered as a possible workshop. As an example, during OSD 2021, workshop topics included: GitHub 101, How to make money contributing to open source, MLOps, inclusive language in open source, CI/CD, and more!

# OSD Participant

### I am new to open source, is this event for me?

Yes! Open Source Day is a perfect event for folks who have little to no experience in open source. Open Source Day is an event designed to provide a safe place for you to meet open source project maintainers, learn from skilled mentors, and code alongside folks who share the same interest. The Open Source Day team and volunteers will be there to support you throughout the day as you find issues suited to your skill level and make your first OSS contribution!
