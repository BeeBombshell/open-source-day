### Is Open Source Day a virtual event or in-person event?  

Open Source Day 2022 is a virtual-only event.

### What is the target audience of Open Source Day?

Open Source Day is targeted toward first-time open source contributors. In the past, we have seen high attendance
 from students and early-career professionals. We have also seen mid-career participants who are skilled engineers
 but are new to open source. We welcome participants of all skill levels to join us to learn about open source!

### How can I participate in Open Source Day?

There are many ways to participate in Open Source Day. We invite you to join us as a workshop speaker, a project partner,
 a mentor, or a participant.

### Is Open Source Day a free event?

Open Source Day is part of [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) (GHC). Therefore, you need a GHC ticket
 to participate. All selected project partners, mentors, and speakers will receive a free virtual ticket to GHC.

### Who can I contact for additional questions?

# Project Participation

### What is the time commitment for project participation?

Before the event, all selected project partners are required to take some time to create good first issues, share
 project guidelines with assigned mentors, and work on a short presentation to introduce the project during the event.

During the event, we require at least one project representative to be present at all times. A Featured project
 can bring up to 3 representatives and Choose Your Own Adventure projects can bring up to 2 project representatives.
 Among the representatives, you are free to divide up the time (8am to 3pm Pacific) to choose who will be available
 at what time.

### Can I submit a project with more than one repository?

Yes! As long as multiple repositories represent one project and project maintainers have the skills to review code
 contributions and have access to merge pull requests in all participating repos.

### Can we reject/close out the pull requests that does not meet our project's requirements?

Open Source Day does not give contributors a shortcut to their contributions. All participants will be required to abide by the project's code of conduct and other guidelines. The Open Source Day team does not expect any of our project partners to accept/merge any work that does not meet the projectâ€™s standards and expectations. We kindly ask you to bear in mind that some participants may be new to open source as you decide how to handle the contributions made to your project.

# Mentor Participation

### What is the time commitment for mentor participation?

Before the event, all selected mentors will be asked to complete onboarding task(s) to familiarize themselves with
 the assigned project. Time spent may vary based on your experience.

During the event, all mentors are required to be present at all times as they will act as the first line of support for
 participants.

# Workshop Participation

### What is the time commitment for workshop participation?

Before the event, all selected speakers will need to prepare their content and attend a rehearsal with one or more
 OSD committee members.

During the event, speakers need to commit approximately 2 hours. Each workshop is expected to be an hour, but we will ask the speakers to join early for production setup and stay after for ~30 minutes to answer questions on Slack.


### What topics would be best fit for Open Source Day workshop?

We accept both technical and non-technical content related to open source. Any topic that will allow OSD participants to walk away with a skill they can utilize in open source contribution will be considered as a possible workshop. As an example, during OSD 2021, workshop topics included: GitHub 101, How to make money contributing to open source, MLOps, inclusive language in open source, CI/CD, and more!

# OSD Participant

### I am new to open source, is this event for me?

Yes! Open Source Day is a perfect event for folks who have little to no experience in open source. Open Source Day is an event designed to provide a safe place for you to meet open source project maintainers, learn from skilled mentors, and code alongside folks who share the same interest. The Open Source Day team and volunteers will be there to support you throughout the day as you find issues suited to your skill level and make your first OSS contribution!
